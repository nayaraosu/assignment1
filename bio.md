Biography

Name: Ashok Nayar

Birthday: January 23rd

Where I live: Claremont, CA (about an hour east of downtown Los Angeles)

Educational Background: BA in Film and Media Studies from Johns Hopkins University

Why I’m pursuing a CS degree: I had taken a few computer science courses at JHU, but I did not enjoy the program at the time. After graduating, I began working in Visual Effects and Animation and ended up programming more and more as my career progressed. The VFX and animation industry is kind of a mess right now and all the technical wizardry I know is not really applicable to careers outside the VFX industry so I decided to enroll in this program to broaden my knowledge. I’m really enjoying it so far!

Fun Fact: I used to work for Pixar.
